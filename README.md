### What I learned

It took a great deal of trial and error but I believe I learned a lot on how to manage to make images responsive and how to work with them in general; this project was actually my first contact with the `<Picture />` element. It was also good to work with Astro on a project that's less about the content, which was what I had mainly focused on until now, and more about the layout. Lastly, something else I used more than expected was the `clamp()` CSS function. I barely had any experience with it before so it took some learning, but it's definitely a great tool to achieve responsive behavior.
